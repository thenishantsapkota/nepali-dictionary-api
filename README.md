#### Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure to override `.env` file to add your own variables.
    ```shell
      cp .env.local .env
      $EDITOR .env
    ```

2. Run the project using the following command.
    ```shell
    make dev
    ```

3. If you're running for the first time, you may want to run migrations with the command.
    ```shell
      make migrate
    ```

4. If you want to seed the database using the currently provided data, run the following command.
    ```shell
      make seed-db
    ```

5. The development service will be live: http://localhost:8000
